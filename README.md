- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jschneLearning, or just Jessica to keep it simple. I am interested in Android Application development, back-end applications, machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and so on. My favorite language is C# with Python coming in as a close second. I know some other languages as well but largely consider myself still a beginner who is learning. 

- This account and the repos it is connected to are intended to showcase my projects as I grow and develop as a programmer and software developer. As I am still learning, I request that if anyone does see fit to comment or make suggestions regarding any of my projects to please provide at least a simple explanation of why certain choices and design elements are better than others.
