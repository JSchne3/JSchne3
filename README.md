- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JSchne3, or just Jessica to keep it simple. I am interested in Full-Stack Web development using .Net Core 6, back-end applications, machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and so on. 

- This account and the repos it is connected to are intended to showcase my projects as I grow and develop as a software developer. As I am still learning, I request that if anyone does see fit to comment or make suggestions regarding any of my projects to please provide at least a simple explanation of why certain choices and design elements are better than others. This will help me to better understand the nuances behind each decision so I can make better choices in the future.
