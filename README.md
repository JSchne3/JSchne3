- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jessica Schneiter. I develop Full Stack Web applications with a focus on back-end operations. I particularily focus on ASP.Net Core, Angular, and SQL. Though I've also worked with various other technology stacks (Such as the MERN tech stack) as well as languages such as Python and Java.

- This account and the repos it is connected to are intended to showcase my projects while I grow as a software developer. I seek always to learn new things, so I request that if anyone does see fit to comment or make suggestions regarding any of my projects to please provide at least a simple explanation of why certain choices and design elements are better than others. This will help me to better understand the nuances behind each decision so I can make better choices in the future.
